A.	Remove spaces from the text and write the characters in a grid of RXC dimension    ----  
B.	Say L is the length of the text after removing spaces
C.	R & C should follow these constraints
a.	[PRESQRT(L)] <= R <= C <= [POSTSQRT(L)]
b.	Where [PRESQRT(L)] = square root of largest perfect square number less than or equals to L
c.	Where [POSTSQRT(L)] = square root of smallest perfect square number greater than or equals to L
d.	Ensure that R * C >= L
e.	In case multiple combination of R & C satisfy all the above constraints, then choose a combination with min [RXC]
D.	Now encrypted text obtained by joining the characters in each column and separated by space
